/**
 * The Toothpick Game is the the most amazing game EVER!
 * The toothpick game is a simple two-player game. The players decide whether they will be able to take 3, 4, 5, or 6 toothpicks per turn (or the computer will randomly determine before each game).
 * The players decide whether they will play one game, best of out 3, best out of 5, or best out of 7.
 * A coin is flipped to see who gets to go first.  A random pile of toothpicks, between 20 and 39 toothpicks, is placed in-between the two players.
 * The players alternate turns choosing toothpicks, and the winner is the one who takes the last toothpick.
 * If the series is not over, e.g. someone hasnâ€™t won a best-out-of-5 match, then a new game is generated, and we play again.
 * Have fun!
 * @Yuanyuan Ding
